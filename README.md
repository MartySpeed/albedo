# John M. Anthony | Web Dev Portfolio

<p>My name is John Anthony, but some know me as Albedo Palazzo. My goal is to become a Software Engineer and I am practicing skills that make me a Full Stack Developer. I have several disciplines to include:
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5 & CSS3</strong></li>
     <li><strong>C#</strong></li>
     <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Javascript</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
  </ul>

I will be show casing my projects that host all of these skills and I would include more as I continue to create more projects and take on more request. My path to becoming better at my craft will be challenging. I am adding Javascript and Python to my Software Engineer tool kit. In addition to these skills, I am also a game developer and work with C#, C++ and Blueprint Visual Scripting. I plan to use and hone all of my skills together to create something that my fingers and brain thirst for. I do know know where my projects will take me, but I plan to make sure that I can explain it, and constantly riase my skills in this process to discover something within myself.</p>

<p>My desire is to create. I do not have a specific what, but I know that is what I want to to, As a Game Developer & Software Engineer, I will strive to join the most dedicated and hardworking programmers out there. Who share my visions of fantasy creatues, cool designs and very digital eye candy.</p>
