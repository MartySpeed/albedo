# hello-world
first project in github

Added a test paragraph for readme

Hello, my name is John Anthony and this is my first projct in Github on the course to becoming a better software engineer. To showcase my work and to see what I am capable of, outside of intruction.

Testing the GitHub desktop application for when I start using this as my main server for future projects.

I have to send this again, I did not include an update with my push to the origin. Do not forget to backup your information, save your new informatiton and always add a note. This helps other programmers see the work that you are doing and vice versa.
